    <h1>Regarding the Artist Materials</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Home educating our four children through many group situations (co-ops, scouts, etc.) led to creating different teaching materials that I thought might be helpful to other people. One class taught was an art, art history and art concepts class that utilized the <a href="https://meetthemasters.com" target="_blank">Meet the Masters Art Program</a> (MTM). Most of the materials offered on the artists page were developed to augment that program. There are no MTM materials available on this website. If you want to teach using the MTM approach please go to <a href="https://meetthemasters.com" target="_blank">Meet the Masters</a>. MTM offers a license that allows the teaching of their program to large groups. Some of the materials on this site can be used in conjunction with the MTM curriculum. </p>
    <p>The students came away from the art class with a notebook that contained a brief biography of each artist, a lesson on an art concept, and a finished piece of their own art inspired by the highlighted artist's work and the introduced art concept(s). </p>
    <p>I chose to teach the class chronologically. Here is a <a href="/images/artistList/chronoList" target="_blank">chronological list</a> of the original 35 artists featured by Meet the Masters. They are the artists whose names are listed in bright blue type on the artist page.</p>
    <p>The biographies and wall display art are presented as pdf files. <!--If you need to change the biographies (another language, perhaps) they can be edited by taking what you want from this <a href= "zipFileAddress" target="_blank">Word Document zip file.</a>--></p>
    <p>There is no charge for the use of these materials, but I ask that you present them free to others as they have been made available to you. That doesn't mean you can't ask for remuneration for printing costs from students, though. </p> 
    <p><h2>Categories:</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Biography</h3></p>
    <p>Typically a four page summary of the artist's life interspersed with their public domain art pieces. The biographies were mostly distilled from Wikipedia.
    <p>Note: if the artist's repertoire includes nudes the nude work will not be featured on these materials, or if so, will be done descretely to protect young students. The artist's biographies will then have an orange <span><em>*N</em></span> on the page to let the teachers know to tell the students that going "off road" on this artist may lead to an exposure they may choose not to have. The wall display pieces offered on this website will not feature nudes.</p>
    <p><h3>Display</h3></p>
    <p>Printable visuals of selected works of the artist. In preparation for each class I would attach them to the classroom wall (using blue tape - so as not to leave residue) and create a "museum." When the students came into the classroom they were encouraged to walk about and check out the artist's works beforehand so that less class time was used for this. At least 45 minutes of the class was guarded vigorously and left soley for the students to create their own pieces. Wherever possible lesson plans are given in the Teach section.</p>
    <p><h3>Teach</h3></p>
    <p>Other materials that could be useful in teaching, but which wouldn't appropriately fit the Biography or Display categories. </p>
    <br>
    <p>May you have much joy in using them in teaching!</p> 
    <p>If you have any comments or questions please email: labELbrass@gmail.com. Also, if you have materials that might also help others that you would like looked over to see if they would add to the site (for art, guitar lessons, scouting), you may use that address as well. All materials need to be of a positive, nuturing nature and scouting materials need to be generic - good for any scouting organization. Also, all materials must be offered for free.</p>
