    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <p>Lisa Brass is fishing for her next work passion. For over 30 years she loved raising children, discovering a teaching bent she never knew existed. So much joy!</p>   
    <p>Regarding this next phase, a major perameter seems to be that work be mobile. Hence reengaging with computers.</p>
    <p>Back in high school she had a class and as the hole punched cards were swept into the card reader, so did her heart. From then on, there was no doubt about her field, it was computers. That is, until small people entered the scene. She took a 30 year detour to parent.</p>
    <p>During those years of teaching, Lisa developed some materials that she thought might be helpful to others. Therefore, part of the motivation of learning web development is try and get those materials out to people who could use them for free.</p>
